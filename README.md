# PercActExam
This repository is made for reproducibility of my exam project for Perception and Action at Aarhus University, 5/1-2024. 
The data from the eye-tracking glasses is not uploaded due to huge files and anonymization limits. Other than that, the rest should be here. Enjoy :-)

The SART code originated from C. Stothart (2015).
